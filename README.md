Project report

Objective
The intended scope of the project includes creating/implementing these 4 aspects:
Characters, building, and other obkects (modeling, texturing and rigging)
Post process shaders
Procedural sky
Random walk for subordinate characters

Result

This is the github link that includes models (with texture and rigging) for the characters and buildings, their renders, and a file to a link of the implemented shader (which can also be found below) 

1. Characters, buildings and other objects 
For characters, I modeled and textured two characters – the main character and the cat. The main character also is rigged to have these actions: walking, crouching, and reaching towards his back. 
For buildings and other objects, I modeled and textured four buildings – three Japanese/Chinese buildings and a tent, two bridges and a staff for the main character.
2. Post process shader
I implemented a shader to have the effect of rain ripples. I tried to imitate the visual effect of an existing rain ripple shader without looking into its implementation. Visually, they are only somewhat similar, and my ripple at times has an undesired effect of the ripples getting smaller, or appearing on the screen for too long. This can be fixed by using dot products rather than 2D coordinates
3. Procedural sky
I did not implement this part.
4. Random walk for subordinate characters
I did not implement this part.
